React JS documentation -- https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react

JSX is the combination of JavaScript and HTML; basically 95% HTML with some minor chnages ; ex -- class changes to className

JSX can return only 1 fragment

Single Page Application -- makes 1 single call for HTML, CSS, Javascript , after which JS takes over 
Multi Page Application -- for each subsequent page, make a seperate call to the server

npm install -- makes node_modules which contains all node modules

State belongs to components 

onclick functions should specify a function and not a function call (Ref : Navbar.js , Line 39)

React routers -- go to another router with server load

Exact in route -- for exact URL matching
